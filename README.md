X509box
=======

Free software GUI for working with X.509 certificates, backed by Qt and GNUTLS. 
For usage conditions, check the file LICENSE in the root of this project.

X509box is an attempt at scratching one of my own itches at work. I'm the guy
responsible for creating certificate signing requests for all our public-facing
hosts and services. This fact turns me into a single point of failure, which is
bad for business continuity.

Generating SSL certificates according to a fixed company policy is apparently
non-trivial for many admins who don't do it on a daily basis. This GUI app is
meant to make this task simple while also tacking on some essential management
features. This should, in the end, make X509box your one-stop-shop for all your
needs in X.509-related artifacts.

Be warned though. This software is in extremely early stages of development.
Use at your own risk!
